**Projet_Camping** is a collaborative 2.5D game developed in Unity at the end of my 2nd year. 

The project challenges players to navigate a foggy forest as a forest guard, searching for a lost child. Strategic use of a rechargeable lantern is crucial, as visibility decreases and interactions with obstacles like bramble walls and wolves further reduce your light.
